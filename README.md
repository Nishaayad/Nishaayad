Hello Everyone! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Nisha Yadav, a passionate and hardworking MCA graduate with a strong foundation in web development, Python, Flask, SQL, and Data Visualization.

I have built several hands-on projects including:

A Quiz Website and Spotify Clone using HTML, CSS & JavaScript

A dynamic Flask-based Web App with user login, form handling, database integration & AI chat using Hugging Face

An insightful Power BI Dashboard for e-commerce analytics


Currently, Iâ€™m exploring the power of Generative AI and building a unique full-stack project called "MyCareerMate â€“ AI Career Companion for Students & Freshers".

With a mix of technical expertise, creative mindset, and a constant thirst for learning, I aim to craft meaningful digital experiences and contribute to innovative solutions.

Letâ€™s connect, collaborate, and create something amazing together!
